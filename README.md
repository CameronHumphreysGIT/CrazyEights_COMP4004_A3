# CrazyEights_COMP4004_A3

Considerations:
My game has a more general definition for a player's turn being skipped, as such, players are notified both
when they are skipped by a Queen and when they are skipped by an Ace (since the direction will be reversed.)

For card Drawing, I loosely define the player "must draw" as being the player will 
have to draw since it is literally the only button they can use.

if this error occurs, selenium is just running slow. try restarting...
org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Timed out waiting for driver server to stop.


(Maybe) Future:
Basic crazy eights game, in future, should consider spring mvc and repositories for cards, 
players and a game, player and deck service.
